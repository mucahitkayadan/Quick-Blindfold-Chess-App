 Blindfold Chess Program with Voice Commands

Blindfold Chess Program with Voice Commands
===========================================

This project is a Python program that allows you to play blindfold chess using voice commands. You can speak your moves into the microphone, and the program will make the moves on the chessboard using the Stockfish chess engine.

Installation
------------

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Clone the project repository:

    git clone [[https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/mucahitkayadan/Quick-Blindfold-Chess-App)](https://github.com/mucahitkayadan/Quick-Blindfold-Chess-App)

4.  Change to the project directory:

    cd your-repo

6.  Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

8.  Download and install the Stockfish chess engine:

    https://stockfishchess.org/download/

10.  Replace the path to the Stockfish executable in the Python code with the actual path on your system.

Usage
-----

1.  Run the Python script:

    python main.py

3.  Make sure you have a microphone connected to your system.
4.  When prompted, speak your move into the microphone using standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e2e4").
5.  The program will validate your move, make it on the chessboard, and then make a move for the computer using Stockfish.
6.  The game will continue until it concludes.
